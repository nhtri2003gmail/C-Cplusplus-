Welcome to Introduction to C++.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Kate Gregory, and I'd like to introduce myself by telling people I've

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
been using C++ since before Microsoft had a C++ compiler.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's well over 20 years, and, in that time, I've seen a lot of changes to the

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
language and to how people use it.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You know if you did a course in college 10 or 20 years where you know somebody

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
who did, and they told you about it, you might not recognize the C++ I'm going to

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
show you.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm going to teach you the basics you need to write good C++.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's the most popular general-purpose programming language ever and one that's still

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
relevant and useful today.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
To get started in this module, I'm going to tell you some of the advantages of C++

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and why so many developers are using it.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You'll also see what C++ CLI is, what C++ OX is, and start to learn what Modern C++

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
is, and why it's the way to write C++ this century, and then you'll be ready to start

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
writing some code.
