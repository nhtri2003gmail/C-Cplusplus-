1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Are you ready to write some code?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I've shown you that C++ is a powerful language that's used by ten million developers

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and more, and it's rich in libraries and sample code, works across a variety of

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
platforms, and gives you tremendous performance.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's what it's all about.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Sure, you may have heard that it's a difficult language, but it doesn't have to be,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
especially, if you write Modern C++.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's clean. It's simple, and it lets the Standard Library do a lot of the work.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Things that you think are too different to do by hand, you probably don't have to do by hand.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Things that you think are hard to read if you do it 1990 C++ way, don't have to be

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
hard to read at all, if you do it the Modern C++ way.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's what I'm going to focus on and show you, and you're going to be productive

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
from the very beginning using C++.
