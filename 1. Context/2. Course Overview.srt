1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'd like to start by giving you an overview of how the course as a whole comes together.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're going to start with context, why C++, what are all these words and terminologies, so

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that you kind of feel you know where you stand, and then get you set up with the tools

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that you need in order to follow along in the demos.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Once that's taken care of, you can get into writing some simple applications that

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
demonstrate the language basics.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You know, like any programming language, C++ lets you declare and work with the variables,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and it's an object-oriented language so you can make objects and define classes, and

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
you can control the flow of your application, like have a loop, do things over and over,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
or check to see if a particular condition holds or not.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The syntax there is just something that we have to cover in order to build larger

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
applications together.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
One of the things that's a little unusual about C++ is the way it actually lets

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
you extend the language to your own objects and classes, and so we have to talk a

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
little bit more about operators than we normally would.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then we can start to talk about templates.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is really something that sets C++ apart from other languages, and it is also

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
one of the cornerstones of C++.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It makes your life simpler.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's not a complicated advanced feature.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's something that you need to know really from the beginning, and then we have

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to talk about Pointers.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A lot of people of scared of pointers, because they were taught Pointers the old-school way.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In Modern C++, the responsibility for memory management is not on the programmer.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There's a powerful Standard Library to help you perform common tasks, so it's all about

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
power, but not about danger, and understanding Pointers in that context gets you

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:59:00,000
positioned to really take advantage of what Modern C++ has to offer.
