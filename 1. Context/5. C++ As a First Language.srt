1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So at least for a moment, bear with me that you agree that C++ is a great language

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to learn and a great language to use, because it is so general purpose in cross

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
platform and powerful in performance, and that although you've heard it's hard,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
you're prepared to believe that Modern C++ is maybe not hard.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now if you already know C# or Java or some other language featuring brace

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
brackets and semicolons, you may feel like, "Okay, I can do this.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
"I'm going to learn this hard thing," even though I've told you it's not real hard.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But, surely, someone who doesn't know a programming language already should never

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
start with something as terrifying as C++.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, I disagree.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think C++ is a fine first language.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
When I started to learn to program, we had less languages to choose from.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But even 20 years ago when I had been doing C++ for while, it was still

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
a really popular first programming language.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Generations of people learned C++ and got out in the world and turned into

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
decent programmers, whether they ended up working long-term in C++ or not.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's certainly true that compared to the kind of C++ that was being taught 20 years

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
ago, C# and Java are way easier.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But you know, that's like comparing a car to like a wood-fired steam engine or

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
something, and thinking that that's saying anything about cars versus trains.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Modern C++ is not too hard for beginners.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Many of the things that used to have to be done right at the beginning around

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
memory management, and pointer arithmetic, and doing a whole lot of stuff by hand,

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that's just not part of Modern C++.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You have a library that helps you, the same as those other languages have libraries

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that help you, and you have some very powerful constricts to keep you safe while

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
you're having high-performance application.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So even if you don't know another programming language, why not get started with C++?

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now in this material, I'm not going to be covering basic programming concepts,

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
like what is a loop and why are things sometimes true and sometimes false, but

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you don't need to feel that, "Oh, I can't learn C++ because I don't know some other

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
language."

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's fine if this is the first language that you take on.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If you do happen to know C# or Java, then you're going to learn C++ pretty

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
quickly, because you're going to recognize a lot and say, "Oh, that's just like what already knew!"

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now there are some things that are different, so don't get too overconfident.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you know old school C++, if you're one of those people who says, "Well, you what?

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
"I've worked with this 10 years ago and now I have to come back to it," you may actually

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
have a tougher time, because you're going to have to unlearn some things that were

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
beaten into you that you really don't need to worry about so much anymore and

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
you can lax a little and trust a little, and I will show you how it's really

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
all going to be okay.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you don't know any programming languages yet, welcome aboard.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're going to have to look a little elsewhere for sort of concepts of programming

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
languages, but you don't need to already know C or C# or Java in order to grasp

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the concept of C++.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You can learn it as your first language.
