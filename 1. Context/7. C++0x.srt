1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Something else you may have heard or read is C++0x.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In order to understand what that is, we need to sort of back up a little

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
bit to who owns C++.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The answer is kind of nobody.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No one person sat down and invented it.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Bjarne, the father of C++, and a number of different compiler venders make C++ compilers,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but the owners of those compilers can't arbitrarily decide to change the language.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, take a language like Visual Basic, which eventually became Visual Basic .NET,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
that's just a language that Microsoft developed and owns, and if they want to add a

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
key word to it, they just add a key word to it.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
C++ isn't like that.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's got a standard that says, "Here are the key words in this language," and

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the standard library that I mentioned is part of the standard.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So there's a standards committee, and they get together and decide whether

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
or not to add a key word or a piece of punctuation.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They decide whether or not to add some capabilities to the library.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The current version, before C++0x, was technically C++03, but most

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
people called it C++98, because 03 was just a little kind of tweaky update.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And to be honest, most people just called it C++ and didn't have any idea

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
what the year was from.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Back when the 03 version finished, there were people saying, "Okay, let's

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
get going on the next one.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
"It's going to be 0 something; we don't know what.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
"It'll be some time before 2009," and right away, the joke was, "Boy,

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
"I hope X doesn't need to be a hexadecimal digit!" now which, of course,

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
it did.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Eventually, it'll probably be ll or 12.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's pretty much done now, has to go through some hoops, and it'll end

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
up being C++11 or C++12.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Of course, we'll just call it C++.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There's some new functionality added, some new key words, some new

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
punctuation, and a lot of very cool stuff in the library, and we'll just

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
use it, and we won't really remember a time when that wasn't there.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You know, I remember a time when certain key words weren't in C++, but

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't go around saying, "Oh, hmmâ€¦oh, you're using that key word.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
"Gees, that was only added in 1998.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
"That's very modern of you," and it'll be the same with these C++0x key words.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
They'll just be normal.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
They'll just be what C++ had in them.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now the standards committee is an interesting mix of people from compiler

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
vendors; people who just care about the language; people who use the language a lot;

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
people from academia; and so on.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And the compiler vendors, it's all been a completely open and transparent process.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
When they could see, yes, we all agree on this, and no matter how long the whole

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
standard gets to put together, one particular aspect is going to be adopted

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
for sure and started to put that capability into the compilers.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So Visual Studio 2010, which has already been released, supports all of the library

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
changes in C++0x, and almost all of the language changes.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So if you're using Visual Studio 2010, including the Express Edition, you can

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
just work with C++0x features that I'm going to show you in this course, and

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
never particularly know whether they're added just now or whether they're from

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
ten years ago, or twenty years ago, or whatever.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Just to be on the safe side, when I show you something that's from C++0x, I

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
will point it out so that if you have some C++ experience from the past,

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
you say, "Wait, I don't think that's a key word," you'll get a little bit of

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
a reminder that's it's a new key word, so that you don't feel that something

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:59:00,000
strange is happened when you weren't looking.
